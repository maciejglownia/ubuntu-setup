#instruction how to make zsh shell a default one, in case the old terminal appears after zsh instalation and configuration

1. Set Zsh as Default Shell Using the Full Path
Run the chsh command again, specifying the full path to Zsh:
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
You'll be prompted to enter your password. After doing this, log out of your session and log back in, or close and reopen your terminal.

2. Verify the Change
After logging back in or reopening the terminal, check again:
echo $SHELL
It should now show /usr/bin/zsh. If it still shows /bin/bash, proceed to the next steps.

3. Manually Edit /etc/passwd
If the chsh command doesn't work, manually edit the /etc/passwd file:
Open /etc/passwd in a text editor with superuser privileges:
sudo subl /etc/passwd
Find the line corresponding to your username. It will look something like this:

username:x:1000:1000:Your Name:/home/username:/bin/bash

Change /bin/bash at the end of this line to /usr/bin/zsh, so it looks like this:

username:x:1000:1000:Your Name:/home/username:/usr/bin/zsh

Save the file and exit the editor (in nano, press CTRL + X, then Y to confirm, and Enter to save).

4. Log Out and Log Back In
Log out of your session completely and then log back in, or reboot your system. This ensures the shell change takes effect.

5. Check if Zsh Starts Automatically
After logging back in, open a terminal and check the shell again:
echo $SHELL
If everything was successful, it should now show /usr/bin/zsh.

6. If the Shell Is Still Not Changing
If you still see /bin/bash after trying all of the above, you might have a session-specific configuration file that forces Bash to start. Check your .bash_profile, .bashrc, and .profile files for any commands that might be explicitly launching Bash. Look for lines like:

exec bash
If found, comment them out by adding a # at the beginning of the line, then save the file and try again.

7. Fallback Method (Auto-switch to Zsh)
As a fallback, you can force Zsh to start whenever a Bash session is opened by adding the following line at the end of your .bashrc or .bash_profile:
exec zsh

This won't technically change your default shell, but it will automatically start Zsh whenever you open a terminal.

After following these steps, your terminal should be using Zsh by default.
